LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a declarative way to build and chain components (like LLMs, prompts, retrievers, etc.) in LangChain, which is a popular framework for building applications with large language models.

🔹 What is LCEL?
LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) allows you to define modular, composable chains using simple, readable syntax.

Instead of writing procedural code to manually connect everything (like prompts → LLM → output parsing), LCEL lets you compose chains in a pipeline-like style, similar to Unix pipes or functional programming.

🔧 Basic Example:
python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser

# Create a prompt
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me a joke about {topic}")

# Initialize LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI()

# Output parser to extract text
parser = StrOutputParser()

# LCEL Chain
chain = prompt | llm | parser

# Run the chain
result = chain.invoke({"topic": "cats"})
print(result)
🔄 The | operator is key to LCEL
It pipes the output of one component into the next — very readable and modular.

🔹 Benefits of LCEL
✅ Composable: Easy to plug components together.

✅ Readable: Cleaner than imperative code.

✅ Flexible: Works with agents, retrievers, tools, etc.

✅ Parallelizable: Supports RunnableParallel, branching, and conditional logic.

🔍 Use Cases
Prompt → LLM → Output Parser

Prompt → LLM → Function calling → Tool

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines

Multi-step reasoning chains
